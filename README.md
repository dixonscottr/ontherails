### Description
|ontheRails is a MTA subway visualization app for the numbered lines (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) which provides users with real-time subway status information. It provides specific train location and time information, as well as overall line service status, e.g. on time or delayed.
Developed for the web, the implemented design is exceptionally responsive for viewing in mobile devices, and fully functional for riders on the go.
